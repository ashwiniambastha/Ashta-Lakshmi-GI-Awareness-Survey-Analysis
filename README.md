📈 Key Results
Statistical Findings
42% gender-based awareness gap identified through chi-square analysis (p<0.001)
State-wise variations: Assam shows highest GI awareness (78%), Mizoram lowest (45%)
Age correlation: Significant positive correlation between age and GI awareness (r=0.34, p<0.01)
Machine Learning Performance
Ensemble Model Accuracy: 87.3% using Random Forest + Gradient Boosting
Feature Importance: Years of experience (0.28), Age (0.24), State (0.19)
Cross-validation Score: 85.6% ± 2.3% (5-fold stratified)
Business Impact
Identified optimal subsidy allocation strategy
Recommended targeted awareness campaigns for specific demographics
Proposed e-commerce adoption framework for traditional artisans
